# Exploring London's Travel Network

![London Tube](tube.jpg)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the London travel network using SQL. By analyzing the `tfl_journeys_final.csv` dataset, the project uncovers patterns in how people move across London, identifying the busiest routes, seasonal trends, and most popular modes of transport within the Transport for London (TfL) network.

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Identify the most frequently used transit types (Tube, Bus, DLR, etc.).
- Analyze seasonal fluctuations in travel volume.
- Determine the peak years and months for specific London Underground lines.
- Practice advanced SQL techniques including aggregations, joins, and window functions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL:** Core data analysis and querying.
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** Used as the environment to run SQL queries and handle the data.
- **Pandas:** For initial data loading and inspection.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset `tfl_journeys_final.csv` contains information about journeys made across the TfL network, including:
- **Month & Year:** When the journeys took place.
- **Network/Mode:** The type of transport (e.g., Underground, Overground, Bus).
- **Journeys (Millions):** The volume of passengers for that specific period and mode.
